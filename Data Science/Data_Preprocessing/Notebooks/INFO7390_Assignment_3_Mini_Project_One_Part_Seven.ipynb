    "#### What Are Regular Expressions?\n",
    "Regular expressions (regex) allow us to perform find and edit substrings within text with great precision. They are useful for a wide range of tasks where you're starting with messy text. Need to standardize the entries users made to a webform? Identify the authors from a collection of newspaper articles? Remove all emoji from dataset? Regex can do all of those and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that regular expressions are incredibly powerful. The bad news is that this power means regular expressions can be complicated: the first book on regex I checked is over 500 pages long. Fortunately, even the most basic regular expressions enable you to do things that would be frustrating or impossible with basic string processing tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, this tutorial is shows you what regex can do and where to look for new commands in the documentation or a cheat sheet. For each of the concepts we cover I'll provide some example use cases and then provide questions that will require you to look up new commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Tools\n",
    "There are a few tools and concepts we need to cover before we start matching patterns. These web pages will be helpful, though you don't need to read through them just yet:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Regex cheat sheet: defines the regex commands we'll be working through.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pythex: this regex tester shows what regex pattern matches. This is especially useful when you get a different number of matches than you expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses regular expressions through the re library. It has several regex functions, but you only need two to get through most use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- re.findall: returns a list of all matching strings.\n",
    "- re.sub: substitutes matching strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Basics\n",
    "The simplest type of regex matches complete substrings in the same way as normal Python string processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In Python, regular expressions are supported by the re module. That means that if you want to start using them in your Python scripts, you have to import this module with the help of import"
